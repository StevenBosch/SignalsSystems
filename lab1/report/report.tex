\section{Summing Sinusoids}
\subsection{}
Our implementation of the function gensinusoid is given in \ref{code:gensinusoid} of the appendix.\footnote{We did all of our coding in Octave instead of Matlab.}

\subsection{}
Using the function given in the previous section we get the graph given in figure \ref{fig1b}.
The amount of samples that corresponds to one oscillation is $f_s/f=8000/400=20$.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{plot1A.eps}
  \caption{The first 200 samples of the signal $x1(t) = 5cos(800\pi t)$}
  \label{fig1b}
\end{figure}
The frequency is $400Hz$ and the sample rate is $8000 samples/s$. This means that $8000/400=20$ samples correspond to one oscillation.

\subsection{}
Our implementation of the function sumsinusoid is given in section A(b) of the appendix.

\subsection{}
The shift of $0.013125s$ translates to a period of $\omega * t = 800\pi*0.013125 = 10.5\pi$. Now we have the following formulas:
\begin{equation}
    x1(t) = 5 cos(800\pi t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    x2(t) = 5 cos(800\pi t + 10.5\:pi)
\end{equation}
We can generate x1(t)+x2(t) by plotting the sum of the separate generated functions given by the function gensinusoid, resulting in figure \ref{fig2d1}.\\
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{plot4A.eps}\\
  \caption{The first 200 samples of the signal x1(t) and x2(t) added.}
  \label{fig2d1}
\end{figure}
Using the sumsinusoid function we can calculate the values for y(t):
$[A, f, phi] = 7.07107,400.00000,0.78540$, giving us:
\begin{equation}
    y(t) = 7.07107 cos(400*2*\pi t + 0.78540)
\end{equation}
The plot with both lines, given in figure \ref{fig2d2}, shows a perfect overlap, so we can conclude that our answer for y(t) is the same as the sum of the two functions. See section A(c) in the appendix for the script that executes the described process.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{plot4B.eps}
  \caption{x1(t)+x2(t) and y plotted in the same figure.}
  \label{fig2d2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{}
When we would combine signals $x1(t) = 5cos(800 \pi t)$ and $x3(t) = cos (1600 \pi t)$ we expect the following would happen: Since the frequency of $x3$ is twice as high as that of $x1$ but its amplitude is 5 times as low,
we expect x1 to dictate the 'main' tendency of the signal (so the higher and longer waves), while per oscillation of x1, x3 changes the values of this wave. Since the phase and frequency are the same, the wave will start at
the value of their amplitudes combined (which is 6). After a half oscillation of x1, x3 will have oscilated once, so the lowest value of the wave is the amplitude of x3 added to the negative amplitude of x1, yielding -4.
Furthermore in between the extremes we expect the positive parts to decrease and increase faster, because both functions are decreasing and increasing respectively at those points. On the other hand we expect
the wave to decrease and increase less quickly in the negative parts, because at those intervals x1 is doing the opposite from x3 (decreasing when x3 is increasing and vice versa). This can indeed be observed in figure \ref{fig1e1}.

For the signal $z2(t) = x1(t) + x4(t)$, we expect that the wave also has a peak of 6, since every 4 oscillations of x4, the peaks of both functions will coincide, yielding the sum of the amplitudes.
As for the minima, after half an oscillation of x1, x4 will have oscillated two times, so the value after half an oscillation of x1 will be $-5 + 1 = 4$. To the left and right of this point will be lower values,
slightly higher than -5, because x4 reaches minima there, but x1 is not at its extreme minimum. We can see this happening in figure \ref{fig1e2}. We can also see that from its maxima and minimu there is a slight
hump, which is caused by x4 oscilating in that interval.

For the combination with $x5$ we expect this behaviour to a much higher extent, yielding a wave that is generally follows x1, but will have many small peaks and valleys within that wave, caused by x5.
This is indeed what figure \ref{fig1e3} shows.

\section{A microphone and some sources}
\subsection{}
For our code, see \autoref{code:2a}

\subsection{}
Two microphones at different locations can receive the signals coming from both of the sound sources in different phases. These phase differences cause the summed signal that the 
microphone sends through to be different. This is explained by the fact that the values of the signals change over the course of one period, so if you shift one of the signals by a part of 
one period, their summed signal will be different. For example,
if we would sum two signals at a time in their oscillation when their value is at a maximum, they would amplify each other (in-phase). Now if we would change the phase of one of the signals 
by half an oscillation, this signal would be at its minimum and the summed signal would be lower (anti-phase). In conclusion, since the location of the microphones determines the relative phase of the received signals,
it also determines the final sum of the received signals.
We used the script we wrote in (a) to create a numerical example, given in answer (c), that shows this phenomenon for the extreme case that two signals double each other for one microphone (in-phase),
while they cancel each other out for the second microphone (anti-phase) (see also \autoref{code:2bc}.

\subsection{}
See \autoref{code:2bc} for the script we wrote, containing the constellation we designed. \autoref{fig2bc} shows the resulting signals of this constellation.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{plot2B.png}\\
  \caption{Three signals: (1) the source signal (the same for both sources), (2) the signals in phase and (3) the signals in anti-phase.}
  \label{fig2bc}
\end{figure}

\subsection{}
We calculate the phase of the perceived signals according to the following method:
\begin{align}
 \lambda = v_{sound} / f \\
 \phi = (s \% \lambda) * 2\pi
\end{align}
In which $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $v_{sound}$ is the velocity of sound, f is the frequency, s is the distance between the 
microphone and the sound source and $\phi$ is the phase. We use Pythagoras to determine the distance between the microphone
and the sound source. Using these calculation, we get the following perceived signals for the three microphones:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Microphone 1 (0,0): $x(t) \approx 5cos(800 \pi t - 2.78)$.
 \item Microphone 2 (50,0): $x(t) \approx 5cos(800 \pi t - 1.45)$.
 \item Microphone 3 (100,0): $x(t) \approx 5cos(800 \pi t - 4.20)$.
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig2d} shows these functions plotted, created using the micfunction, given in appendix \autoref{code:2a}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{plot2D.png}\\
  \caption{The signal $x(t) = 5cos(800 \pi t + \phi)$ at location (0,100) received by microphones at locations (0,0), (50,0) and (100,0) ($f_s = 8000$).}
  \label{fig2d}
\end{figure}

\subsection{}
\autoref{code:2e} gives our implementation of requested function. Given two signals the function shifts one of the two signals
for the range of the highest wavelength of the two signals, with a step size of $1/f_s$. For every such phase we calculate the sum squared error over the least common multiple of the two frequencies of the signals.
We use the least common multiple of the two frequencies, because after that amount of oscillations by the signal with the smallest
wavelength, the two signals reach the same point again. Finally we have the shift (the amount of shifted samples) that yields us the lowest sum squared error and
from this we can calculate the phase shift that yields this least sum squared error.

Using this function for the signals in (d) ($x1(t) = 5cos(800 \pi t - 2.78)$, $x2(t) \approx 5cos(800 \pi t + 1.45)$ and $x(t) \approx 5cos(800 \pi t + 4.20)$)
we get the following resulting phase shifts:
\begin{itemize}
 \item x1 and x2, gives us $\phi \approx 5.03$, subtracting $2\pi$ yields $-1.25$, which is close to the difference in phases between the signals: $-2.78 - (-) 1.45 = -1.33$.
 \item x1 and x3, gives us $\phi \approx 1.57$, close to $-2.78 - (-)4.20 = 1.42$.
 \item x2 and x3, gives us $\phi \approx 2.83$, close to $-1.45 - (-)4.20 = 2.75$.
\end{itemize}
Of course we would want to get a delta $\phi$ of exactly $-1.33$, $1.42$ and $2.75$ respectively, since the frequencies and amplitudes are the same
but just the phase is shifted. However, because we use a certain number of samples and therefore information gets lost,
the function does not find the perfect values. If we, for example, increase the number of samples to 20000 for the last delta, 
we get a phase shift of approximately 2.76, which is already much closer to the actual value.

\subsection{}
The equation defines a hyperbola because....

The code in \autoref{code:2f} gives our implementation of the function. To determine the delay between the microphones, 
the phase difference between the perceived signals is necessary and the frequency of the signal. The delay is calculated 
according to the following function:
\begin{equation}
 delay = \delta \phi / (2\pi f)
\end{equation}
